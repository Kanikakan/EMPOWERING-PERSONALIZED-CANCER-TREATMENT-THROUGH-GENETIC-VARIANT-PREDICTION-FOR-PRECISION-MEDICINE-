# EMPOWERING-PERSONALIZED-CANCER-TREATMENT-THROUGH-GENETIC-VARIANT-PREDICTION-FOR-PRECISION-MEDICINE-
The emergence of precision medicine and genetic testing has the potential to revolutionize disease treatment strategies. Specifically, in the context of cancer treatment, the challenge lies in deciphering the multitude of genetic mutations within a tumor and distinguishing between those driving tumor growth and those that are inconsequential. Currently, this process is labor-intensive, with clinical pathologists manually reviewing and categorizing mutations based on textual clinical literature. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning algorithm that automates the classification of genetic variations. Leveraging a wealth of clinical evidence, the algorithm will be trained to categorize mutations into nine distinct classes. The provided training data includes genetic mutation descriptions and corresponding clinical evidence, while the test data includes machine-generated samples for evaluation. By bridging genetics and clinical knowledge, this project strives to enhance personalized cancer treatment through efficient and accurate mutation classification.
